# Tyler Chartrand's Coding Challenge

## Time

I spent around 2 hours total on this program, not including installing VS Code and Python and Git.

I have been very busy with homework and work the last 2 days, and started the project at around 9:50 Thursday evening. I usualy use Linux, so I had to set up my Windows development enviorment before I started by installing VS Code, Python, Git, and Github Desktop. I read the challenge file for the first time at around 10:10, and submitted the link to my partialy working project by email at 11:59 (The program could only go from Roman Numerals to Integers, not back yet). 

At around 12:20 Friday morning, I finished the project, and pushed my final edit to main.py to Github. At around 12:30 I wrote this README. (I'm not sure how in depth to go for this report)

## Dependencies 

The only dependency to run the program is to have Python 3.12.2 installed, and the ability to import the built in regular expression library

## Notes

The only notes I wrote down were while trying to wrap my mind around the roman numeral to integer algorithm. Those are included as comments in my main.py file
